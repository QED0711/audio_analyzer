# Audio Analyzer

The code in this project provides a means of comparing two audio files through visualization to see their similarities and differences. A detailed walkthrough for how to implement the custom classes is provided in the `main.ipynb`. Additionaly, you can find a writeup and sample analysis using these tools at [this medium article](https://medium.com/@qdizon/a-data-scientists-approach-to-visual-audio-comparison-fa15a5d3dcef). 

## Project Contents

* [main.ipynb](https://github.com/QED0711/audio_analyzer/blob/master/main.ipynb) - Documentation and implementation for the `AudioAnalyzer` and `SpetrumCompare` classes.

* [python](https://github.com/QED0711/audio_analyzer/tree/master/python) - Contains the main code base in the `AudioAnalyzer.py` file.

* [audio](https://github.com/QED0711/audio_analyzer/tree/master/audio) - Contains sample audio for the demonstrations. 

## Required Packages

In order to implement these classes, you will need the following packages installed in your environment:

* `numpy` 
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `scipy`
* `librosa`

Also, if you are using linux, you may also need to install additional codecs if you want to use MP3 files and not WAV files.
